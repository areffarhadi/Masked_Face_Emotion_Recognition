# Masked_Face_Emotion_Recognition
Masked Face Emotion Recognition Using CNN in GoogleColab and MATLAB Software

please download the MATLAB version of VGGFace2 CNN from this link of [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CCniQEl1uQB94Zg2vmSnzv-cIpFmsazL?usp=sharing).


Using separate scripts for each net in MATLAB, you can easily fine-tune three CNNs: AlexNet, Squeezenet, and VGGFace2.

This Repo is the implementation of the paper entitled: [Facial Emotion Recognition Under Mask Coverage Using a Data Augmentation Technique](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10326241) published in the ICCKE2023 conference. [Mirror Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.01335)
